In my 15 years' experience in professional software development, I
started with .Net/C\# language, continued my career in mobile
development (Nokia platforms, Qt/C++) to finally become a Python/Django
backend developer. During these years I also became an expert user and
administrator of Linux systems. I am constantly striving to learn new
technologies and to improve my skills. My ideal working place is an
Agile environment where Test Driven Development and Continuous
Integration are the norm and where I can balance my work between writing
code, pairing and mentoring junior developers.
