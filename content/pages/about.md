My name is **Andrea Grandi** and I live in **London (UK)**. I
work as **Python/Django** developer for **Government Digital Service (GDS)** which is part of the **Cabinet Office**.

In my spare time I like to work on opensource projects (I'm learning
**Go** language at the moment and developing **Django/Python**
applications), attend local meetups and building stuff with **Arduino**
and **RaspberryPi**.

You can contact me at this address: **me** *\[at\]* **andreagrandi.it**
