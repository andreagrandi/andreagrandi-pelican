My name is **Andrea Grandi** and I live in **Italy**. I
work as **Python/Django** developer for **LaterPay** a German company with a fully distributed and remote team.

In my spare time I like to work on opensource projects (I'm learning
**Go** language at the moment and developing **Django/Python**
applications), attend local meetups and building stuff with **Arduino**
and **RaspberryPi**.

You can contact me at this address: **me** *\[at\]* **andreagrandi.it** - Note: I do **not** authorise anyone to use
this email address for advertisement nor to contact me with unsolicited services (recruiters: I'm talking to you!).
