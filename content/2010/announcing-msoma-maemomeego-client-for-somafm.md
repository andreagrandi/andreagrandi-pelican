[SomaFM](http://somafm.com) is a streaming radio with near 16 different
channels, available for free. Even if it's possible to copy-paste their
streaming URLs to N900 Media Player, we
([me](http://maemo.org/profile/view/andy80) and [**Lorenzo
Bettini**](http://maemo.org/profile/view/lorebett)) decided to create a
custom application, to make channels switching easier for the end user
and to be able to add more features. We decided to take advantage of the
new **Nokia SDK** and write the application in Qt/C++. Source code is
available on [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/msoma) and it's always
updated with latest version we're working on. If someone want to test
the application, it's available in **extras-devel** repositoryÂ  ("msoma"
under Multimedia section) of N900.

The UI is still in development as you can see. The application is
already usable, but of course we have to work hard on the user
interface. Feel free to test/use it and send us any feedback. If you
want to contribute to our project (coders are welcome) please send us a
patch with your code or ask us to be added to mSoma development team in
Gitorious.
