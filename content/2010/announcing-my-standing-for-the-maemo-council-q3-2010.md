I've decided to candidate myself again (yes, I wasn't elected last time)
for the [Maemo Council
elections](http://lists.maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-community/2010-August/004399.html).
During these months I've tried to help more the Maemo Community and I've
started working to two Qt/C++ projects. Here you can find something more
about me.

Name: **Andrea Grandi**  
maemo.org profile: **Andy80** - <http://maemo.org/profile/view/andy80/>  
Corporate affiliation: none

**Introduction:** My name is Andrea Grandi, I live in Italy and I'm a
Computer Science student. I've worked for some years as a software
developer, then I started university. I'm part of the Maemo Community
since 2007. Since then I like to help new users, organizing events,
developing applications for Maemo. During this year I've started
developing applications using Qt/C++ for N900, to be ready when MeeGo
for handled devices will be out. I really like to collaborate with other
community members to build together the best product ever.

**My life in the Community:**

- **May 2008:** PyMaemo: Python for Nokia Internet Tablet @ PyCon Italia
2 -

- **September 2008:** ESBox and Pluthon Eclipse plugins: how to use
Eclipse to develop Maemo applications @ Maemo Summit 2008 -
<http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2008>

- **Summer 2009:** I worked to python-mafw bindings, during a stage in
[**Igalia**](http://www.igalia.com).

- **October 2009:** python-mafw: MAFW framework for Python developers @
Maemo Summit 2009 - <http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009>

- **May 2010:** PySide: Python Bindings for the Qt Framework @ PyCon
Italia 4 -
<http://www.pycon.it/conference/talks/qt-mobile-pyside-bindings>

**Current Activities:** I'm currently working to two Maemo/MeeGo
projects. The first one is **mSoma**, a Soma.Fm client that I'm
developing with Lorenzo Bettini. The other one is **LastGo**, a Last.fm
client. Both applications are written in Qt/C++ and are using QtMobility
as multimedia libraries.

**mSoma**: <http://gitorious.org/msoma> -

**LastGo**: <http://gitorious.org/lastgo> -

**Motivations:** I really would like to be able to do more for the
community and one of the best way could be to be part of the council, to
help both users/developers to explain their requests to Nokia and Nokia
to understand the requests from the community. There are a lot of
fantastic ideas coming from the community that could improve what we are
doing: the key is to organize them and giving them more attention. This
is what I've always looked for: working together to build something
great! This will be probably the last Maemo Council, since now we
(Maemo) and them (Moblin) are all part of the same community: MeeGo, and
I'd like to help Maemo people to feel the most comfortable possible in
our new Community.
