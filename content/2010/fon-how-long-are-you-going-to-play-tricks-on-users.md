already know, **Fon** is a spanish company that some years ago had the
interesting idea of creating a **wifi community** to share the Internet
connection. The idea is quite simple: each "fonero" buy a Fonera (the
router sold by Fon), register it on the Fon system and get a
username/password. If the fonero travels around the world he's able to
connect to wifi signal of other foneras and browse the web for free.

When I bought my first fonera few years ago, I was one of the first
people in my city. I bought it because I was really beliving in this
project. During these years Fon produced new models of fonera and I
bought each of them (the WRT54 router, Fonera, Fonera+, Fonera 2.0g,
Fonera 2.0n ecc....). Since first year, the Fon community has grown a
lot and now there are a lot of foneros around the world.

Actual situation
----------------

Few months ago Fon launched a very interesting product: **Fonera 2.0g**.
Thats's not only a router. Fonera 2 is capable of managing torrents,
rapidshare downloads, uploading photo on Facebook and Flickr, and much
more. Whats's wrong with this product? It's **very unstable**! There are
a lot of users that bought this router when it was anounced and they're
still waiting for a lot of bugs to be fixed by Fon developers team
(composed by only ONE person!). Why users had to wait so long?

Simple! They were working to Fonera 2.0n! Wow! Faster router, more RAM,
4 ethernet port, wonderful! But... another very unstable router! And
with unstable I mean: it **disconnects/reboots often**, connection is
unstable, applications don't work ecc.... I'm talking about a 79â‚¬
router, not about something that users had as preview product. Me and
other users were still waiting for an uograde when... Fon [announced a
new
product](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/fon-to-unveil-new-fonera-at-mobile-world-congress.html)!
Yes, another one!

Fon priority is not to fix a product that thousand of users have already
bought. Fon priority is to produce and sell a new product!

Conclusion
----------

It could be only my opinion, but I don't trust you anymore Fon! I'm
really disappointed about your behaviour you had with your customers.
I've already spent (wasted) a lot of money with your not-working
products and I'm not going to buy your products anymore! I'm tired of
being illuded by your promises: how long are you going to play tricks on
users?
