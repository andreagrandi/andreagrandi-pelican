**What is Maemo Coding Competition?**

This competition has been organized by Maemo Community for the Maemo
Community. Developer can work to an application and submit it for one of
the six categories available: Desktop, System & Utilities, Games,
Graphics & Multimedia, Location & Navigation, Other. Another category is
available too, and it's for beginner developers. The competition entry
has now ended, but voting is open. You can find more information about
the competition, in the official wiki page:
