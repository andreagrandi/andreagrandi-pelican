Introduction
------------

My name's **Andrea Grandi**, I'm italian and I'm a Maemo
user/lover/contributor since the **Nokia 770**. I love **Python** as
development language and few months ago I also gave some contributions
to the [**PyMaemo**](http://pymaemo.garage.maemo.org/) project.

In these days I had the idea to start writing a **Twitter** client for
**Maemo** with a precise direction in my mind. I'll try to explain all
my reasons here. First of all I've to thank the author of
[**Mauku**](http://mauku.henrikhedberg.com/) client. I use it since its
first version and I'm quite happy with it. Then, why do I want to write
another one?

1.  **Maemo** (MeeGo) is moving to **Qt** and for this reason I'm going
    to use Qt, while Mauku uses Gtk.
2.  I'm learning Qt and what is better than writing a complete (but not
    too complex) application to learn better?
3.  Mauku is not free as lot of people could think. Reading the source
    codeyou find this "You are NOT allowed to modify or redistribute the
    source code.", while I want to write a client and release it under
    **GPL2** or **GPL3** license.
4.  Mauku is not updated since some months and we have no news about it.
5.  I love Python and I like to write free software in this language.
6.  I want to give to Maemo a stronger contribute.

My request for help
-------------------

Before lot of people start writing their own client resulting in 4-5
twitter clients for Maemo, why don't we join our strength and work to a
common project? I'm not a Python expert nor a Qt one, but I've some
experience as project/team leader and since this is not a complex
project, I would be glad to lead it. So, I'm looking for Python
developers, Qt developers, UI designers and whoever want to contribute
to this project. I still have to find a good name and logo for this
application.

Who want to help me?
