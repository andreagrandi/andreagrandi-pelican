If you upgrade Spotify for Linux to 0.8.8.x version and you have some
network connection problems (for example you're behind a company
firewall and need to set a proxy...) the application will crash/hang
without letting you doing anything (neither setting Proxy informations)

This is caused by a deadlock in the GUI and you can view the complete
debugging informations hereÂ <http://pastebin.com/zcKgXEqz>  
To fix this, you just need to open this file
**\~/.config/spotify/prefs** and add these two lines:

\[sourcecode lang="text"\]  
network.proxy.addr="123.123.123.123:1234@https"  
network.proxy.mode=2  
\[/sourcecode\]

of course substituting **123.123.123.123:1234** with your
*proxyip:proxyport*.
