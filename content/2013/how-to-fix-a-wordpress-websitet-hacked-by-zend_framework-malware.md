I admit. **This website**, like thousands of others, **has been
hacked**! I still have to identify the precise source of the attack, but
I've found out that is very common. I was able to discover about the
attack just because the dashboard of WordPress stopped working. I
decided to investigate and I found this strind on top of every .php file

Just googling I discovered that I was not alone

How to fix this?
----------------

The best solution would be to restore the files with a valid backup, but
sometimes this is not possible. Here comes an handy bash solution (note:
you need to be able to access your hosting with a SSH shell to execute
this command): <http://pastebin.com/V3nFwwtZ>
