[PyCon2]{style="font-weight: bold;"} is the second edition of the
[[Italian Python
Conference]{style="font-weight: bold;"}](http://www.pycon.it/) and will
take place on [May 9/10/11]{style="font-weight: bold;"}, 2008 in
[Florence]{style="font-weight: bold;"}.

The conference is organized by [Python
Italia]{style="font-weight: bold;"} and more than
[300]{style="font-weight: bold;"} developers, students and researchers
will be present for three days of tutorials and other important events.

PyCon 2008 edition will be opened by [Richard
Stallman]{style="font-weight: bold;"} with a keynote on [Free

I'll partecipate at the conference as speaker on May 10, with a talk on
"[PyMaemo: Python for Nokia Internet
Tablets]{style="font-weight: bold;"}". In particular I'll talk about
Maemo platform, Maemo SDK (how to install and configure it) and I'll
explain how to use the two Eclipse plugins
[ESBox](http://esbox.garage.maemo.org/) and
[Pluthon](http://pluthon.garage.maemo.org/).
