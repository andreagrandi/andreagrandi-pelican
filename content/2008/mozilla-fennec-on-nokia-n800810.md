is a particular version of Mozilla, designed for handled devices and
internet tablets. With the latest development version, stability has
been improved, but the application is still a bit slow and "memory
hungry". Speed an memory improvements are scheduled for the next release
(Alpha1 - September 9, 2008).

Latest available version, **Fennec M7**, has the following improvements:

-   Initial Add-on Manager support has landed. Tap "+" button in the
    sidebar to display the Add-on Manager. Use it to install, view and
    remove add-ons. Use the application menu button to dismiss the
    panel. Clicking on an add-on XPI in a webpage will also display the
    manager. The current UX design is not final.
-   The top URL bar has been changed to work as designed: The bar will
    scroll into view at the top of the web content or will float over
    content otherwise.
-   Support for kinetic scrolling has been added to the web content.
-   Support for non-modal Password Manager UI was added.
-   Some tabbed browsing fixes.
-   Some zooming fixes.
-   Some stability fixes.

To install it on your tablet, you've to configure Application Manager
with the following parameters:

-   **Web Address:** <ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mobile/>
-   **Distribution:** chinook (Note: The chinook builds work on diablo
    as well.)
-   **Components:** release

If you're not sure or if you want further instructions about installing
Fennec, you can find a [step by step
