I've updated my previous howto that explain how to install [Maemo SDK 4
(Chinook)]{style="font-weight: bold;"}. The other howto was written when
Maemo SDK 4 Beta was out, now it's updated to
[4.0.1]{style="font-weight: bold;"} version of the SDK.

You can find it, as usual, on this wiki:
<http://www.ptlug.org/wiki/Howto_Installing_Maemo_SDK_4>

If you have any suggestion or if you want to give me any idea to improve
this howto, please leave me a comment.
