I was looking in the Italian Nokia official shop, and I noticed that the
**N800** price was decreased to **259€** instead of **289€**

You can verify it on the [official website](http://shop.nokia.it/nokia-it/searchresults.aspx?sku=3525335&wt=PHALL&ws=0%2c19549522&culture=it-IT#__anchor_ProductSelector).

Maybe the **N810** is coming closer? 
Who knows ;)
