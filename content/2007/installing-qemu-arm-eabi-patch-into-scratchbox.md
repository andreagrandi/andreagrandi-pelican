Using Scratchbox and in particular the Maemo SDK with ARMEL target, very
often when we try to execute some application we can get into this kind
of errors (for example):

`sem_post: Function not implemented`

This happens because not all the functions have been implemented in the
emulated environment.[ Lauro Ven√¢ncio]{style="font-weight: bold;"} has
created a [patched](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qemu-arm-eabi/)
version of qemu-arm called [qemu-arm-eabi]{style="font-weight: bold;"}.

Thanks to [Marcelo Lira]{style="font-weight: bold;"}, we have a simple
howto to install the patch into the Scratchbox environment.
[Note:]{style="font-weight: bold;"} you have to execute these commands
from outside the Scratchbox environment and you should not be logged
into the environment at the same time.

[1.]{style="font-weight: bold;"} You need gcc 3.4, SDL dev library and
Zlib dev:[  
]{style="font-size: 78%;"}

`sudo apt-get install gcc-3.4 libsdl1.2-dev zlib1g-dev`

[2.]{style="font-weight: bold;"} Get the patched qemu-arm. Notice that
the patches are already applied, everything is here, and you don't need
to get the qemu sources.

` svn co  https://qemu-arm-eabi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qemu-arm-eabi qemu-arm-eabi cd qemu-arm-eabi ./configure --target-list=arm-linux-user --static make`

[3.]{style="font-weight: bold;"} Copy qemu to the cputransp dir on
scratchbox[  
]{style="font-size: 78%;"}

`sudo cp arm-linux-user/qemu-arm /scratchbox/devkits/cputransp/bin/qemu-arm-eabi-sb2`

[4.]{style="font-weight: bold;"} Add it to the list of cputransp
methods. Open the file[  
]{style="font-size: 78%;"}

`sudo vim /scratchbox/devkits/cputransp/etc/cputransp-methods`

and add this line:

`qemu-arm-eabi-sb2`

[5.]{style="font-weight: bold;"} Configure the target to use the patched
qemu as transparency method. Edit the file:[  
]{style="font-size: 78%; font-family: courier new;"}

`vim /scratchbox/users/USERNAME/targets/CHINOOK_ARMEL.config`

and change this line:

`SBOX_CPUTRANSPARENCY_METHOD=/scratchbox/devkits/cputransp/bin/qemu-arm-eabi-sb2`

That's all! You're now ready to log again into your Scratchbox
environment.
