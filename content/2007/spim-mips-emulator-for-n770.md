**Spim** is a self-contained simulator that will run **MIPS32** assembly
language programs. It reads and executes assembly language programs
written for this processor. spim also provides a simple debugger and
minimal set of operating system services. spim does not execute binary
(compiled) programs.

I made a port of **spim** for the **Nokia 770/800** device just for fun
and to start learning how to do ports.
