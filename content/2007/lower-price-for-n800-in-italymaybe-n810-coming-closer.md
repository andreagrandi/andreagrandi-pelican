.size-full .wp-image-98 width="246" height="154"}I was looking in the
Italian Nokia official shop, and I noticed that the
[N800]{style="font-weight: bold;"} price was decreased to [259
€]{style="font-weight: bold;"}instead of [289
€]{style="font-weight: bold;"}You can verify it on the [official
website](http://shop.nokia.it/nokia-it/searchresults.aspx?sku=3525335&wt=PHALL&ws=0%2c19549522&culture=it-IT#__anchor_ProductSelector).

Maybe the [N810]{style="font-weight: bold;"} is coming closer? Who knows
;)
