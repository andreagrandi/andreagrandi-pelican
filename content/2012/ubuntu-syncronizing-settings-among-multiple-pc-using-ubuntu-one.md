Using more than one computer, often it would be useful to have a way to
synchronize settings among multiple computers. For example you change
the desktop wallpaper on your office PC and you want to find the same
wallpaper when you go back home on your personal PC or on your laptop.
Language settings, online accounts, privacy settings ecc... are only few
examples of settings you could want to have synchronized.

**[Ubuntu One](https://one.ubuntu.com/)** already gives you **5 Gb**
space for **free** and it's available for everyone activating it. It's a
perfect place for storing a shared folder with all those settings. Of
course not a simple folder, a special one. Applications use settings
taken from usual \~/.appName and a daemon takes care of synchronizing
data once you're connected to Internet. Just like Ubuntu One does with
your documents.

How do I choose which settings to synchronize? First of all you have to
**activate an Ubuntu One account**, if you don't have already done it,
then you just have to choose the settings you want using this tool
available in **Ubuntu System Settings**

What? A mockup?! Isn't this tool available yet??!! Exactly :) This tool
is not available **yet**, but I think **it would be an interesting
feature to talk about** for the next (not precise, I mean 12.10) Ubuntu
release. What do you think about?
