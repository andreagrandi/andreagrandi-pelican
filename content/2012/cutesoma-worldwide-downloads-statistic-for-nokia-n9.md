[CuteSoma](http://store.ovi.com/content/205737) (Soma.fm client for
Nokia N9) has been available for 4 months now and it's the right time to
publish some interesting statistics about downloads. First of all I
didn't expect so much interest and I wasn't sure to have so many
downloads, due to the fact that Nokia never advertised this device
properly. But luckly lot of people don't care about advertising and buy
a product anyway if they know it's one of the best available on the
smartphone market.

I'm really happy to notice that the number of downloads is growing each
month, this motivates me to continue with development (well... when my
N950 comes back from Nokia, since I had to send it because it was
broken).

I want to thank all the **3658** people that downloaded CuteSoma until
now and all the people that are sending me their feedback, ideas and
patches (yes **Cornelius Hald**, I'm talking about you :D ) you're
giving me a big opportunity to learn **C++/Qt/QML**.
