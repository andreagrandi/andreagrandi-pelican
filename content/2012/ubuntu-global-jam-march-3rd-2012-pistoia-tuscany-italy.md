Even this time **[Pistoia Linux User Group](http://www.ptlug.org)**
decided to join the international event **["Ubuntu Global
Jam"](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam)** organizing it in
collaboration with **[Ubuntu-it Community](http://ubuntu-it.org/)**. The
international event will be on **March 2nd, 3rd and 4th** and we have
decided for **March 3rd (saturday) from 15:00 CET to 19:00 CET**. This
event will be organized in a room made available by **Circolo ARCI
Bonelle**. We'll have a room capable of about 100 people and a smaller
one with 4 PC and a big table for people who want to bring their own
laptop. **Wifi** internet connection will be available for everyone.

The event will be introduced by a talk made by **Paolo Sammicheli** of
the [Ubuntu-it Community](http://ubuntu-it.org/) and then we will divide
in some smaller groups that will dedicate to different tasks. One will
be coordinated by **Paolo Sammicheli** and will be dedicated to testing
and bug triaging. Another group will do some translations from english
to italian and will collaborate directly with italian translation team
talking with them on a dedicated IRC channel. The last group will be
leaded by a very good **Unity** rockstar..... (suspance)...... **Marco
Trevisan**! People collaborating directly with him will try to help
fixing some bugs or at least they will learn how to get started to bug
fixing (probably we will pick a bitesize bug and we will fix it
together).

We've created an [event on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/151257404993865/) and invited
all our friends to attend. We really hope that many people will
partecipate to this opportunity to make the next Ubuntu version more...
"**precise**"!
