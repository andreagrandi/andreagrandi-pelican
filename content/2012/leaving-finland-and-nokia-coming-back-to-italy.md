After a very pleasant experience in **Finland (Tampere)**, I've finally
come back to Italy. I had the opportunity to work for three months in
**Nokia** as "*Qt Expert*" in "*Nokia Developer Forum*" and it's been an
amazing job!

To be more precise I left Finland on August 31th, but I didn't have much
time to blog about this. Finally I can use my desktop PC again and I'm
not anymore limited to my small netbook. Trust me... spending 3 months
with a 11'' netbook and pretending to work normally is really
frustrating.

Now I have more spare time (too much :\\ ) to contribute to Ubuntu and
to play with some new technologies: I'm working on a project that uses
**Arduino**, **Android** and some "robotic" parts, with people of
[**Pistoia Linux User Group**](http://www.ptlug.org) and it's really an
amazing learning experience!

Talking about Ubuntu, if you have never contributed to it and you would
like to start with something easy, I suggest you this interesting
initiative <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/BugFixingInitiative>

In the mean time I'm also looking for new opportunities and challenges
(aka = looking for a new job), so if you think you may be interested in
me, take a couple of minutes to give a look to my LinkedIn
profile <http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreagrandi>

I will attend next **UDS** in **Copenaghen** (99% sure) and I already
have a couple of topics I would like to work with, but I will talk about
these later, first I want to properly create a blueprint in Launchpad so
we will have a starting point.
