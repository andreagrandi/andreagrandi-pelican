I recently prepared a presentation about
[**Factoryboy**](http://factoryboy.readthedocs.org), a Python library
that automates lot of the work when a developer needs to create some
data for unit testing.

I've been using this library since a couple of months, both in the
company where I work and on a personal open source project I'm working
on. I will give a presentation about this library in an internal
workshop in my company and I'm available to give it in any Python/Django
related event around **London**, if anyone is interested.

The slides are already available:
