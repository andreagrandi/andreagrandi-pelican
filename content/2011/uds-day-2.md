day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn
air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I
relly wanted to follow the **Wayland** one, but when I arrived the room
was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not
to enter.

I attended "**What's wrong with UDS and how we can fix it**" session
before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the
session in general,Â for example giving them a proper order so that a
team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss
how to design them.

We had another wonderful and tasty **lunch**, even if I didn't eat so
much, but food was very good anyway.

During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: "**Recommend music
based on current song playing or on users media library**". We discussed
the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on
user's tastes.

I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and
uploading pictures.

After the sessions we had the **Linaro Showcase**: lot of demo running
on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with
Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During
the showcase there was a very nice dinner.

After dinner I went out with my friend **Manrique Lopez** who is here in
Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer.

Before coming back to the hotel me, **Marco Trevisan** and **Andrea
Azzarone** had a nice talk with **Jorge Castro**. He really make us feel
part of the Ubuntu family!
