left from **Firenze** with my friend **Marco Trevisan**, to go to
**[Ubuntu Developer Summit](http://uds.ubuntu.com)** in **Budapest**. We
changed flight in **Rome** where we met also **Andrea Azzarone**.
Unluckly **Alitalia losts Marco's baggage**, so he's still waiting for
it.

We arrived at the hotel at 20:00 more or less where we met other people
of the community. There are **lot of italians** at UDS. Most work for
Canonical, other were sponsored by.

I met **Marianna Raffaele** (one of the UDS organizer... yeah, she's
italian too!), I had to explain her a little problem I had with my
booking (nothing bad) and she managed to help me. She also gave me a
very nice guitar plettre with Ubuntu logo. Thank you Marianna for this!

We went out with **Jorge Castro** to drink some beers (he offered me
one, thanks Jorge!!!) and we met lot of other Ubuntu people. A really
amazing start!
