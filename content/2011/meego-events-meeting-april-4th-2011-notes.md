MeeGo Conference Updates
------------------------

﻿We have **315** registrants as of today for the conference, so numbers
are looking good without having any agenda published yet! A good portion
of sessions should be approved by April 8th, this Friday and you will
receive an email when/if your session has been approved yet. Not all the
sessions will be approved by Friday though so if you do not hear from
the committee then do not worry they are probably just working through
it. The program committee is tenatively planning to have a first draft
of the Agenda up by April 15th. **Sponsored Travel attendees** should
start receiving approvals during next week and approvals will continue
through April 25th.
