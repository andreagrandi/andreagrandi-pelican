this morning I didn't wake up early because I still felt sick (I already
know this sore throath won't abandon me untile I go back home).

I had a **light breakfast at 10:30** and then I finishes uploading some
pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before.

While waiting to attend a session, I found **Mark Shuttleworth** around
and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu.
Without a similar distribution, I'm pretty sure that Linux would not be
so popular today.

We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of
presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then "**Cooking Recipes**"
for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to **Wine**. The Wine session was
so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the
images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk
;)

After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn't feel
very well, but I was able to attend "**Unity's relations and
dependancies on GNOME**" thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking
questions and etherpad to take notes.

I attended also "**desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y**" where there was a
discussion about the state of **Unity** and what can be improved before
**Oneiric** release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about
accessibility.

Last session of this day, a
**[Q+A](http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/other-o-sabdfl-community-qa/)**
with **Mark Shuttleworth**. The session was very interesting! He replied
to all questions coming from the public and from IRC.
