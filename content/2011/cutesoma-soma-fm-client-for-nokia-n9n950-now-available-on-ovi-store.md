**CuteSoma** is a client of **[Soma.Fm](http://somafm.com/)** streaming
radio that I wrote using Qt/QML for **Nokia N9** and **Nokia N950**.
Previously it was available as a .deb only, now you can install it
directly from the **[OVI Store](http://store.ovi.com/content/205737)**.
It's only a 0.1 version and even if it's quite stable it may contains
some bugs: please report me any bug so I can try to fix them as soon as
possible.

There is a poll available to let the final users choose the new icon for
this application, you can find it
here: [http://forum.meego.com/showthread.php?t=4619  
](http://forum.meego.com/showthread.php?t=4619)I asked for help to
design a new icon and I received two, so I'm letting the final users
choose which one they like most.

To get this application you need to search "cutesoma" on **OVI Store**
client or visit this link <http://store.ovi.com/content/205737>

Please remember that CuteSoma is **free**, but if you want you can make
me a **donation** or offer me a beer using the "Donazione" button on the
right column.
