Using PGP can be quite hard, even if you have a lot of experience with computers.
By the way encryption is what gives us privacy and permits us to safely transmit information
and for this reason it should be easy to use, for everyone.

[Keybase](https://keybase.io) really makes encryption easy to use.

### PGP identity

When Keybase was launched it was mainly a wrapper for PGP commands
to encrypt and decrypt a message for a certain user, but it also introduced a very nice
chain of trust.

In Keybase it's possible to either generate a new PGP key or import an existing one
but the most important thing is being able to verify our own identity using multiple proofs.

Many of us have a personal blog, a Twitter or Facebook accounts, a GitHub account etc...
All these accounts combined together make our online identity.

Every Keybase account can be verified by other online identities. In Keybase
you don't just say "I'm Andrea Grandi, this is my PGP key...". In Keybase you
can link your existing online accounts to your Keybase account and show additional
proofs of your identity.

Unless an attacker controls all your social accounts, they cannot impersonate and verify
themselves as if they were you.
