I must admit, I wasn't using Maemo email client, because I did find it
was simply unusable, at least with my GMail account.

I tried both POP3 and IMAP, but having about 25.000+ messages in my
account, downloading just the headers was a job that the client simply
couldn't manage.

Yesterday I knew about "**recent mode**" support in **POP3**, a
functionality that **GMail** supports too. This mode allow you to
download **only last 30 days** messages (in my case, no more than 1000)Â 
so the client can manage them without any problem.

All you have to do to enable this mode is put the "**recent:**" string
before the username. For example: if your username is
"username@gmail.com" you have to write "**recent:username@gmail.com**".
Important: this mode only works with POP3, not with IMAP.

To conclude, let me say **thank you** to the kind guy who let me
discover this mode. Thank you

thing I can do with my tablet!
