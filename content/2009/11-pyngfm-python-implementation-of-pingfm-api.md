I've just released [PyngFM](http://code.google.com/p/pyngfm/), a Python implementation of
[Ping.fm](http://ping.fm) API. Ping.fm is a simple service that allow
you to update multiple social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Jaiku ecc...)
with a single post. You can find complete source code and documentation
on the official website: <http://code.google.com/p/pyngfm/>

Please contact me if you have any suggestion or if you find any bug in
the code, so I'll be able to fix it.
