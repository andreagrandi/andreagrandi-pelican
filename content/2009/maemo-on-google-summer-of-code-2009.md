[**Maemo**](http://www.maemo.org) community will try to join the
**[Google Summer of code](http://code.google.com/soc)** program again.
Google Summer of code can be a very good opportunity for the Maemo
Community, and can also give a lots of good things, like new
projects/features and new people developing for Maemo.

In order to apply to Summer of code, we need help from the community, we
need project ideas, mentors and interested students. The mentor
organizations submissions starts in **March 9**.

There is a [wiki page](http://wiki.maemo.org/GSoC_2009/) with some
information regarding the Maemo participation in GSoC, feel free to add
more information to the pages, especially for people that participated
in previous editions of GSoC.

In 2007 some Nokia employee offered their help as mentors and backup
mentors, will be fine if that happens this year too.

***Note:** I reported this news thanks to **Valerio Valerio** who wrote
this on **maemo-community** mailing list.*
