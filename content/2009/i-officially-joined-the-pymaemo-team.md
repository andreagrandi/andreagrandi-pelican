This summer I'm working for 2 months at [Igalia](http://www.igalia.com),
a spanish free software company, and they assigned me the project of
writing a **Python binding** for **MAFW** (a new multimedia library that
will be included in **Freemantle**).

After few days I discovered that
[**PyMaemo**](http://garage.maemo.org/projects/pymaemo/) team was
already working to it, so I asked to join them and they accepted me!

I really love Python language and since I think other developers love it
too, I think we should provide good bindings for every library available
in Maemo, so lot of developers can start writing their applications in
this language.

I'll work to this project full time until the first week of september,
so I hope to be able to learn a lot and to contribute as much as I can
to this project.

If anyone else want to join PyMaemo team and help us to develop Python
bindings, I think he will be welcome!
