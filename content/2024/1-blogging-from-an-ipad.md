Summary: Writing posts from my iPad for my static generated blog

A few years ago, I [migrated](https://www.andreagrandi.it/2017/07/02/migrating-from-wordpress-to-static-generated-website/) from my Wordpress based blog (which I self hosted… yeah… I know… no comment!) to a static generated (using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/)) one which is hosted (for free!) on GitHub Pages.

This setup, believe me or not, is cool. I’ve all my blog posts written in MarkDown, versioned on and kept safe on GitHub and when I’m ready to publish, I just need to make a pull request, merge it and a CI job will take care of using Pelican to build the pages and push them to the right place. You can find more information about my setup in [this other post](https://www.andreagrandi.it/2019/02/24/how-to-deploy-static-website-github-pages-circleci/).

So, what’s the problem? Well, as you can imagine, to do all of this, you need a GitHub client, a MarkDown editor and you need to be able to commit, push and do pull requests.

Is this  possible from an iPad? I believed it wasn’t (since the official GitHub client is very limited on what you can do, and online IDEs like VsCode.dev requires an internet connection, and I would like to be able to write also when I’m offline), but thanks to a [blog post](https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/running-blog-ipad/), I recently found out it’s possible!
