Summary: Kagi is a paid search engine which gives you search results you are actually looking for. It doesn’t track you and doesn’t have any ads.

It’s a not a [news](https://mashable.com/article/google-search-low-quality-research) anymore that Google, the search engine which once was the best available, doesn’t work anymore for a lot of users.

Its results are full of ads, they are not **optimised** for [users](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/biased-google-search-results-are-hurting-users-harvard-study-claims/135824/), nor for [advertisers](https://simpleblog.ai/blog/google-ads-can-do-more-for-customers/) and sometimes they also include [malware](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2023/01/18/google-ads-increasingly-pointing-to-malware/). Their main goal is **to boost ad revenue**.

So why it’s still the most used search engine in the world? Well that’s “easy”, because Google **[pays](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion)** (a lot!) **to be the default search engine** everywhere and users are often lazy to change their habits or don’t know alternatives are available.

## My impressions

After hearing a lot of good things about this search engine (especially from the folks on Mastodon), I decided to give it a try (there is a **trial plan available** with 100 search queries included, so don’t take my word and please test yourself!).

The first impression was terrific. I was finally able to find what I was looking for with the second or third (and sometimes with first) link in the results.

With Google I usually had to scroll past a few **ads**, then ignore **old web pages** (but with a good SEO), then go past another couple of **irrelevant links** and finally find what I was looking for. But the point is that you never know how bad the results are until you click, read a few lines and take a decision. At that point you already have **wasted a lot of time just** to find the right thing.

With Kagi I just save a lot of time, get better results and nobody is tracking what I search for to serve me related ads at later time.

The customisation [features](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-features) make the results I get even better and more tailored to my needs.

## Why choosing Kagi

**Privacy:** there are **no ads** in the results and there is **no tracking** in place. What you search is private. While Kagi relies on some existing search engines (Google, Bing, Brave etc…) they use them as a source of data and all the queries are always anonymised before being sent to them. Once their requests are back, results are aggregated and customised for the user.

**User custom results:** users can decide to exclude certain websites from ever appearing in their results, or rank higher or lower certain other websites. Tired of always seeing that click-bait website appearing? You can block it! Do you prefer to first look stuff in Wikipedia if available? You can rank it higher etc…

**Lenses:** once you get your results back, you can decide to filter them further by using lenses. For example you can use the “*Recipe*” lens, to search specifically for recipes, or the “*Discussions*” one to search inside discussion forums.

**Instant answers:** sometimes you can get an instant answer when you search for something, which already includes a lot of information, without the need to click on the found link. For example, searching for `Python for loop` will give you this:

**Summariser:** this feature is still experimental, but I think it’s one of the best features available (AI haters please look somewhere else!). **Kagi Summariser** is able to create a summary of almost any public resource you can provide: a link to a web page, a podcast, a YouTube video etc… it uses AI to transcribe audio/video and then it creates a summary of it. It saves me a lot of time, depending on what I’m looking for.

## Using Kagi with Safari

I use Safari as my main browser and unfortunately this browser doesn’t let you add any custom search engine, so Kagi engineers had to use a quick hack. They released a **Safari extension** which intercepts any query sent to your default engine and redirects it to Kagi. My personal advice? Change your default engine to **DuckDuckGo** or something else you trust if you don’t want to leak stuff to Google.

## Pricing

Kagi doesn’t offer a free plan (it only has a **trial with 100 queries** included) and it has three paid plans:

- **Starter:** it costs 5$/month and includes 300 queries/month
- **Professional:** it costs 10$/month, has unlimited queries and includes AI tools like Kagi Summariser
- **Ultimate:** it costs 25$/month, it’s like Professional plan but you get preview access to features which are still in development

I personally have the **Professional** plan.

## Conclusions

I hope I stimulated your curiosity to at least convince you to use the trial. I’m curious to hear your opinions.
